# 📟 EventBoard - RTC-Driven Message Display System  

## 📖 Overview  
The **EventBoard** is a real-time, microcontroller-based message display system designed using the **LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller**. Its primary purpose is to automatically display predefined messages at specific times on a **16x2 LCD screen** with a scrolling effect. The system leverages the **built-in Real-Time Clock (RTC)** of the LPC2148 for accurate timekeeping.  

In addition, the project provides a **secure Admin Mode**, allowing authorized users to edit the system time and manage scheduled messages. This is implemented using an **external interrupt switch**, **keypad**, and **password-protected access**.

- 16x2 LCD display with scrolling  
- 10 predefined messages stored in memory  
- Secure Admin Mode via switch, keypad & password  
- Admin can update RTC time and enable/disable messages  
- LED status indication:  
  - 🟢 Green LED → Active message display  
  - 🔴 Red LED → Idle mode  
- LM35 sensor for real-time temperature monitoring

## 🔄 Working Principle  
1. RTC keeps track of time continuously.  
2. When the current time matches a scheduled message:  
   - Message scrolls on LCD.  
   - Green LED turns ON.  
3. If no scheduled message is active:  
   - LCD shows current time & temperature.  
   - Red LED turns ON.  
4. Admin Mode:  
   - Entered via external switch (interrupt).  
   - Access protected by keypad password.  
   - Allows time editing & message selection.
